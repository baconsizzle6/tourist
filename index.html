		<h3>History of the Alaska</h3>

		<p>
			Alaska was admitted to the union as the 49th state in 1959, and lies at the extreme northwest of the North American continent. Acquired by the United States in 1867, the territory was dubbed “Seward’s Folly” after U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, who arranged to purchase the land from Russia. Critics of the purchase believed that the land had nothing to offer, but the discovery of gold in the 1890s created a stampede of prospectors and settlers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Alaska is bounded by the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north; Canada’s Yukon Territory and British Columbia province to the east; the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south; the Bering Strait and the Bering Sea to the west; and the Chukchi Sea to the northwest. The capital is Juneau.

				<p>Speeding through Alaskan forest, sitting on a sled that's being pulled by some of Alaska's most powerful creatures. This is dog sledding—and it's not only an Alaskan tradition, but also a state obsession. Celebrated every March with the 1,150-mile Iditarod Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome. Taking a dogsledding excursion is a chance to see what the fuss is all about. </p>

				<p>June 21 is the longest day of the year, with 19 hours of daylight in Anchorage, 22 in Fairbanks, and 18 in Southeast. But from early May through September, days are considerably longer than at lower latitudes. Alaska's sky is light nearly all night long from late May to late July (unless you're out and about at 3am). And it's light past 10pm for another month on either side of that. </p>

		<h3>Explore with us!</h3>
		<p>People visit Alaska to experience the scenery and the wildlife, sure—but to really connect with the Alaskan way of life and learn what makes Alaska different from everywhere else in the U.S., you have to meet actual Alaskans. And let’s face it, getting to know the locals is a great way to hear about about the state’s best-kept secrets, go to favorite local restaurants, and avoid falling prey to the kitschy tourist traps. In short, it’s the best way to not just see Alaska, but experience everything that makes the 49th state unique.</p>

		<h3>The Local Landscape</h3>
		
		<p>It doesn’t take you very long to see a distinction between Alaskans and those visiting from outside the state. You don’t know the true definition of independent and eclectic living until you meet a local. </p>

		<p>Most people don’t simply end up in Alaska—residents have made an intentional choice to invest their lives in this unique and rugged place. A great conversation starter is simply asking what brought a local to Alaska. People from all walks of life and corners of the world have chosen to make their home here. Alaskans have a strong sense of kindness and comradery. They are adventurous, highly capable, creative people who share a love for the awe-inspiring natural beauty and satisfying hard work. It takes some true grit to live here.</p>
